# Flights Management
<h3>A second year university project.</h3>

<i>~ A newer version of this algorithmic task will be done.</i> ðŸ›©

* Made for the <b>CS103 Algorithms & Data Structures</b> course.
* Has an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest flight path and minimum time spent traveling (but not waiting while connecting flights).
* Meaning in reference to the previous bullet point: No A* algorithm upgrade (no real node heuristics).
* Usage of various data structures.
* A graph theory problem solved in an airports + flights setting.
* No kind of GUI was created for this project.
